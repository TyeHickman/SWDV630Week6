# Week 6 - ORM
## Tye Hickman

Using either your objects for week 8 (if you are working ahead) or any object from earlier weeks, write the code necessary to use SQLAlchemy to store and retrieve objects from the internal SQLite database.   Provide an appropriate test/driver application that shows you are able to store and retrieve objects from the database.
